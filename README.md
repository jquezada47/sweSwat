## Getting enviroment started
Install nodejs: 
    Go to [www.nodejs.org](www.nodejs.org) to download the latest version (12.x LTS version, 13 may be buggy with react/npm)
    This will allow the compiling and running of javascript and react code locally

## IDE/Coding Enviroment
Any IDE with text editor and terminal will work, but Visual Studio Code is a good IDE with extensitons that help with coding and has built in terminal. It also has git integration so it can pull, commit, and push to github.
